ðŸš€ Introducing Our New Ping Pong Game: Built with C! 

We are excited to present our group project, Ping Pong game made using C and the Raylib library!
This game was a collaborative effort between myself, Nusair Tasin  and Sajid Al Adeeb.
Why C? 
As a 1st year undergraduate student the first language we learned is C. So in order to evaluate our skill we were given a group based project that has to be c based. As we are a curious bunch we wanted to be creative. So we decided to make a game using C. C isnâ€™t usually the first language that comes to mind for game development. It doesnâ€™t offer the advanced tools that popular game engines like Unity or Unreal offers. But working within the constraints of C gave us a chance to think outside the box and create something unique with just the essentials.
Why We Went with It Anyway:
Itâ€™s About the Basics: While C isnâ€™t optimized for making games, using it helped us explore the fundamentals of a game mechanics. From loading screen to the precise calculation of the ball's movement. We used Raylib, a simple and accessible library, which made C a lot more manageable for building our 2D Ping Pong game. Itâ€™s straightforward but has all the basics that we needed to make the game.
Important Takeaways:
We gained a greater understanding of low-level programming by creating a game using c.
We wanted to test our skill and gain experiences.
As we are still learning so your opinions will be much valuable. So please play the games and let us know your feedback.
